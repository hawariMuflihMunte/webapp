# webapp

Simple Web App

## Run

Make sure you have `ruby` installed in your local.
After that, let's check it by typing

```bash
ruby -v
```

And now it will display the current version of your `ruby`.

Then, you'll need to install Ruby on Rails. Simply install

```bash
gem install rails
```

Wait for it...

After installation step is done, you can now create Ruby on Rails app

```bash
rails new <appname>
```

And then move to the project folder

```bash
cd <appname>
```

Please not that `<appname>` is just a placeholder. It can be whatever you want to be. In our case, it is `webapp`.

After move to the project folder, now we can start the development stage

```bash
rails server
```

Access your app at `localhost:3000`
